# ZebraPuzzle
To run both Z3_written_original.ipynb(written by me) and Chatgpt_generated_z3code.ipynb(generated using the app):
Install jupyter lab and z3:
pip install jupyterlab
pip install z3-solver.
Next run jupyter lab on your system using the command:
jupyter lab.
Next, copy and paste the python codes into new cells in the notebook and execute them.
Due to API, Heroku and FlutterFlow costs I have paused these transactions, to use the app please email me using my Trinity email and I will make the app functional again and provide you with steps on how to access it. 
Until then there is a video included in this repository called app.mp4 which shows how the app functions.
Also there is a custom__Z3_python script I developed, however as explained in the report using this custom script would be very restrictive since the aim is to handle various zebra puzzles.
