# ZebraPuzzle
To run both Z3_written_original.ipynb and Chatgpt_generated_z3code.ipynb:
Install jupyter lab and z3
pip install jupyterlab
pip install z3-solver

Next run jupyter lab on your system using the command:
jupyter lab
Next, copy and paste the python codes into new cells in the notebook and execute them.
Due to API, Heroku and FlutterFlow costs I have paused these transactions, to use the app please email me using my Trinity email and I will make the app functional again and provide you with steps on how to access it. 
Until then there is a video included in this repository called app.mp4 which shows how the app functions.
